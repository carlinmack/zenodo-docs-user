The following section explains how you submit an **unpublished record** to a community for review.

##### Only drafts

You can only submit drafts (i.e. unpublished records) to a community (see [submit to community](../submit-to-community/) for submitting published records).

##### Both uploader and curators can edit

Both you as the uploader and the curators of the community can edit the metadata and files of the draft when you submit it for review.

##### Published when accepted

The record is automatically published when the curator(s) of the community accepts your record into the community. If the review is declined, you can choose to submit the record to a new community, or you can publish it without a community.

Submit your record for review in 3 simple steps:
